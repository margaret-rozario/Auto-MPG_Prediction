# Title: Auto MPG Prediction Model

# Description: 
This machine learning model, built using Python, predicts the fuel efficiency (measured in miles per gallon or MPG) of a vehicle based on various physical attributes, such as its horsepower, displacement, and weight. The project includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model building, and evaluation steps. It aims to provide accurate predictions to help consumers make informed decisions when purchasing a vehicle.
